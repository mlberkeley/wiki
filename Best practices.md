# Best practices

Please follow these guidelines when editing articles in the wiki. 

1. Highlight the big ideas, the important caveats, and practical tips first. Assume that readers will look up involved, obscure, and complicated details if and as they need. 
2. Be charitable with other's work. Aim to edit and add to the material in this wiki, not delete.
3. An article should ideally be about 1 concept or topic. As a rule of thumb, it should be a short noun phrase. Think Wikipedia article titles.
4. The article should start by explaining the idea at a high level (Summary). Next, explain why it is important or when you would use it (Strategy). Finally, if relevant, go into the justification (Analysis).
5. Pages should be written in markdown, which is the default setting. Markdown is a human-readable (i.e. close to plain text) format and all popular editors and wiki tools can render it out of the box.
