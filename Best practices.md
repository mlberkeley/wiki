Here are best practices for using the wiki.

1. Highlight the big ideas, the important caveats, and practical tips first. People can look up involved or obscure details.
2. Be charitable with other's work. Aim to edit and add to the material in this wiki, not delete.
3. An article should ideally be about 1 concept or topic (i.e. should be a noun phrase)
