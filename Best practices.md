Here are best practices for using the wiki. 

1. Highlight the big ideas, the important caveats, and practical tips first. Assume that readers will look up involved, obscure, and complicated details if they need.
2. Be charitable with other's work. Aim to edit and add to the material in this wiki, not delete.
3. An article should ideally be about 1 concept or topic (i.e. should be a noun phrase).
4. The article should start by explaining the idea at a high level (Summary). Next, explain why it is important or when you would use it (Strategy). Finally, if relevant, go into the justification (Analysis).
