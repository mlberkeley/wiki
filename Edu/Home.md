# Edu Wiki Home

The point of the edu section of wiki is to both store all our edu content and also provide a centralized way to peruse technical wiki articles. Each edu module will provide an overview of this topic / area with links to technical wiki articles that actually go into mathmatical detail on that idea / paper / etc.

If you would like to contribute, please contact someone on edu. Version control on these modules needs to be really tight since all these modules are interconnected and changes to the content of one module may effect downstream modules and slide decks will need to be updated too. That being said, we want to realize the grassroots potential of wiki, so please don't let us get in your way, just be cautious and thoughtful about your changes and keep edu in the loop since we're the ones that are responsible for maintaining the modules subfolder of /edu.
