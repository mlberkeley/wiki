# Wiki Tutorial

This is a brief tutorial on using and navigating the wiki. 

# How does wiki work?

This wiki is ultimately just a folder of text files -- see for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlberkeley/wiki). But by using an open-source package called [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), we're able to host these files on a pleasant front-end at [mlberkeley.wiki](https://mlberkeley.wiki/Home). Anytime you make a content change to wiki on the website, gollum records it as an ordinary git commit. We use gollum because it has lots of convenient features, as you'll soon find out.

# Editing a page

Make sure you know [[Best practices]] and [[How to write a wiki article]] before changing anything.

|Action|UI|Keyboard shortcut|
|------|--|---------------|
|Edit|Button in top right|Tap _e_|
|Save|Green button bottom right in editing mode|Press _Cmd+S_|

Go to a page and try to edit it. What you see in the editor is the whole source for the file. To see how your changes will appear to the reader, go to the preview tab above. Feel free to put a more descriptive commit message in the box if you like. Then click 'Save' or just press Cmd+S.
