# Wiki Tutorial

This is a brief tutorial on using and navigating the wiki. 

# How does wiki work?

This wiki is ultimately just a folder of text files -- see for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlberkeley/wiki). But by using an open-source package called [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), we're able to host the wiki with a pleasant front-end at [mlberkeley.wiki](https://mlberkeley.wiki/Home). Anytime you make a content change to wiki on the website, gollum records it as an ordinary git commit. We use gollum because it has lots of convenient features like

- Editing and previewing changes in the browser
- Support for many markup languages
- Rendering $\LaTeX$ in the browser
- BibTeX citations
