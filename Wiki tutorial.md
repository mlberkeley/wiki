# Wiki Tutorial

This is a brief tutorial on using and navigating the wiki. 

# How does wiki work?

This wiki is ultimately just a folder of text files -- see for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlberkeley/wiki). But by using an open-source package called [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), we're able to host the wiki with a pleasant front-end at [mlberkeley.wiki](https://mlberkeley.wiki/Home).

To edit a page, tap the _e_ key or click on Edit above.
