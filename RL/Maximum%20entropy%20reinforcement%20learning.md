# Maximum Entropy Reinforcement learning

**Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL)** is a variant on the standard RL formulation where we encourage our policy to have as high an entropy as it can. You'll want to understand that formulation first before you dive into this one.

# Analysis

This section is for going a little deeper. Try to analyze (break apart) how the method or idea works. What's the key equation or theory that makes this work? Or what was the primary insight of the paper?

# Synthesis

Think of this section as expert-level. The reader knows the high-level idea as well as the fundamental building blocks. Put it together for them. Don't be afraid to present a complicated proof if you deem it relevant.
