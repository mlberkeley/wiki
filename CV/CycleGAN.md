# CycleGAN

CycleGAN is a method for unpaired image-to-image translation introduced in @https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1703.10593. 

Unpaired image-to-image translation
: Given a domain of images $X$ which have some correspondence to a domain of images $Y$, learn a mapping that takes an $x$ and produces the corresponding $y$.

If we had a dataset $\\{x_i, y_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, this would be a simpler, supervised learning problem. Unpaired means that what we have is $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\\{y_j\\}_{j=1}^M$.
