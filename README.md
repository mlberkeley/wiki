# wiki

1. Articles for culture + philosophy in the root folder. TL;DR: as long as you make contributions in good faith (e.g. not deleting other people's work), it's allowed. But we'll have a review team for either every 5 posts or every week. 3 phase system for notes: in-development, under review, reviewed, finalized (this note is set in stone)
2. Good practice to link to other resources (code, slide decks, google docs maybe, etc.) The wiki itself should just be text, equations, images, links. Code repos go somewhere else.
3. Use Obsidian to look at the graph if you like
