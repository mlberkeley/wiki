One reason we use gollum is that it supports $\LaTeX$, a popular math typesetting software. In any file in the wiki, you can use LaTeX to include nicely rendered math.

If you want the math to appear inline like $1+1=2$, then you should put it in single dollar signs: `$1+1=2$`. On the other hand, if you want it to appear as its own line, then put it in double dollar signs `$$1+1=2$$`: $$1+1=2.$$
