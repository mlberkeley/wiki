This is a tutorial on editing a page in the wiki. To make the wiki democratic and allow it to grow with us, we've enabled editing for anybody. But with great power comes great responsibility, so read carefully!

**Golden Rule**: If you're absolutely sure of the change you're making (e.g. it's clearly a typo or grammar mistake or just a note you want to add), by all means go ahead and make the change. But if you're at all unsure, use CriticMarkup to put your suggestion in the wiki and then contact somebody on the wiki team.

What is CriticMarkup? CriticMarkup is a markdown syntax we've enabled to make editing changes. Here it is, in practice:

- This is {--is --}a test.
- This {++is ++}a test.
- This {~~isn't~>is~~} a test.
