# How does wiki work?

This wiki is ultimately just a folder of text files -- see for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlberkeley/wiki). But by using an open-source package called [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), we're able to host these files on a pleasant front-end at [mlberkeley.wiki](https://mlberkeley.wiki/Home). Anytime you make a content change to wiki on the website, gollum records it as an ordinary git commit. We use gollum because it has lots of convenient features, as you'll soon find out.

Most of the information on this page can be found in the [gollum documentation](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki).
