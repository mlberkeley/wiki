**Principle Component Analysis (PCA)**. Make sure you understand [[ordinary least squares]], which is the supervised learning analogue, and [[singular value decomposition]].


PCA is a method for dimensionality reduction. Let's say we have data in the form of a [[design matrix]] $X \in \RR^{n \times d}$.
