**Singular value decomposition (SVD)** is an extremely powerful matrix decomposition because it applies to any matrix; in particular, it says that any matrix $A \in \RR^{m \times n}$ can be written as

$$
A = U\Sigma V^\mathsf{T}, \tag{Full SVD}
$$

where $U \in \RR^{m \times m}$ and $V \in \RR^{n \times n}$ are orthogonal matrices and $\Sigma \in \RR^{m \times n}$ is non-zero only on the diagonal.
