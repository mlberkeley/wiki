Information theory is a field that covers and intersects a lot of ML disciplines, which is why we have a whole folder for it.

## Recommended Reading

- @MacKay2003 is a great introduction to info theory for ML. [Prereqs](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/prereq.html) listed here.
- @6773024 is the OG paper that started the whole field. ([PDF mirror](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf))
- @https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2106.12062 develops some much-needed systematic notation for information-theoretic quantities, which we use in this wiki.
